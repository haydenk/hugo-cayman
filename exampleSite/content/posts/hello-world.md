## Why Hugo?

Hugo is an amazing static site generator that offers:

1. **Speed** - Hugo builds sites incredibly fast
2. **Simplicity** - Easy to use and configure
3. **Flexibility** - Highly customizable themes and layouts
4. **Security** - Static sites are inherently more secure

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Hugo!")
}
```
